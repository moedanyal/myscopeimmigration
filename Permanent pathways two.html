                    PNP is one of the most important and popular programs to gain permanent residence of Canada. The PNP program is very often considered an alternate to the federal skilled worker program and has its advantages.
                    
                    To encourage immigration and to meet labour shortage, each province nominates individuals based on work skills, experience and education to improve its economy. Each province has its own programs and selection criteria.
                    Almost all provinces in Canada have an agreement with the Government of Canada that allows them to nominate applicants for permanent residency.
