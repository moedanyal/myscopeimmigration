                    <span class="highlight">EXPRESS ENTRY: </span> Canada welcomes approximately 400,000 new immigrants every year.<br> 
                    Express Entry is a selection process through which IRCC selects Candidates for Permanent Residence in Canada. All applicants make an expression of interest and are entered into a pool of applications. Highest ranked Candidates are invited to apply for Permanent Residence via regular draws. This is one of the fastest ways for immigrating to Canada directly as a permanent resident, if you qualify. Applicants receive points for factors like: Age, Education, Language, Work Experience, and Adaptability etc.<br>
                    
                    NOTE: Please note that Express Entry applications are much more than creating an initial profile. It is a crucial stage and missing, incomplete or wrong information or inability to provide required documents after receiving an Invitation to Apply, can not only lead to a refusal, but can also jeopardize your chances for permanent residence in future. We can guide you through the complex maze of the process including guiding you how to obtain a provincial nomination and use it for additional points for your Express Entry.

                          PNP is one of the most important and popular programs to gain permanent residence of Canada. The PNP program is very often considered an alternate to the federal skilled worker program and has its advantages.
                          
                          To encourage immigration and to meet labour shortage, each province nominates individuals based on work skills, experience and education to improve its economy. Each province has its own programs and selection criteria.
                          Almost all provinces in Canada have an agreement with the Government of Canada that allows them to nominate applicants for permanent residency. <br>
