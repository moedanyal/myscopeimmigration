                    <span class="highlight">EXPRESS ENTRY: </span> welcomes approximately 400,000 new immigrants every year.<br> 
                    Express Entry is a selection process through which IRCC selects Candidates for Permanent Residence in Canada. All applicants make an expression of interest and are entered into a pool of applications. Highest ranked Candidates are invited to apply for Permanent Residence via regular draws. This is one of the fastest ways for immigrating to Canada directly as a permanent resident, if you qualify. Applicants receive points for factors like: Age, Education, Language, Work Experience, and Adaptability etc.<br>
                    
                    NOTE: Please note that Express Entry applications are much more than creating an initial profile. It is a crucial stage and missing, incomplete or wrong information or inability to provide required documents after receiving an Invitation to Apply, can not only lead to a refusal, but can also jeopardize your chances for permanent residence in future. We can guide you through the complex maze of the process including guiding you how to obtain a provincial nomination and use it for additional points for your Express Entry.
