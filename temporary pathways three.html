                                        Because of its competitive wages, high workplace safety standards, and numerous professional growth opportunities, Canada welcomes large numbers of foreign workers every year.
                                        In most cases, a work permit is required for foreign nationals to work in Canada.
                                                 .
                                        Work Permits are often the first step towards your goals and getting it right from the first time is indispensable for your future.
                                        
                                        Whether your goal is to gain valuable Canadian Work experience for career advancement in your home country or becoming a permanent resident in Canada, MYSCOPE IMMIGRATION SOLUTIONS can help you achieve them.
                                        
                                        There are mainly 2 types of Work Permits:<br>
                                        <br>
                                        	<strong> Closed Work Permit</strong>   <br>
                                            <strong>Open Work Permit </strong> <br>
                                            <br>
                                        <span class="highlight"> CLOSED WORK PERMITS</span>  <br>
                                        Closed work permits only allows you to work for a specific employer. For many applicants, they require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Without a positive LMIA, the employer will not be able to offer you a job, even if you are qualified. This means that the employer must prove that there is no Canadian citizen or permanent resident available to do the job which is being offered to a Temporary Foreign Worker.
                                        The success of a closed work permit application depends on many factors, such as:
                                        Your application must include convincing evidence that you have the required experience, skills & knowledge to perform the job duties outlined in your Job letter.
                                        The Job Letter should have a detailed list of duties you will perform, your compensation, and the length of time you will be working (both hours and total period).  <br><br>
                                        <span class="highlight">OPEN WORK PERMITS  </span>  <br>
                                        Unlike a closed (or employer-specific) work permit, which strictly limits you to a particular employer, an open work permit allows you the freedom to work almost anywhere in Canada. It allows you to work for any employer in Canada, except for those who have failed to comply with the employment standards or who engage in sex trade such as strip clubs, escort services, or erotic massage parlours.
                                        You do not need a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) and you do not need a job offer.
                                        
                                        WHO QUALIFIES FOR AN OPEN WORK PERMIT?  <br>

                                        If you have submitted your permanent residency application and are waiting for the results, you may apply for a Bridging Open Work Permit. Your spouse also qualifies for an Open Spousal Work Permit   <br>

                                        If your spouse is currently on a study permit or work permit, you may automatically qualify for an open spousal work permit. This open work permit would be connected to your spouse’s visa.<br><br>
                                        <span class="highlight">INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</span>  <br>
                                        If you recently graduated from a designated Canadian post-secondary institution, you may be eligible for a Post Graduate Work Permit, which is also an open work permit. Post-graduate work permits are only given to those who you apply within 180 days of receiving your final grades.

                                        As with all work permits, there is an expiration date. You must either stop working on that date or apply for an extension before expiration.
                                        Once you have applied for an extension, you have implied status, and can continue working until a decision is made.
                                        NOTE: Some open work permits cannot be renewed, such as a Post-Graduate Work Permit. The validity of your passport may also limit the length of your work permit.
